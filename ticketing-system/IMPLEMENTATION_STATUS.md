**Atomic Reservation Implementation:**
```sql
INSERT INTO tickets (event_id, section_id, seat_number, user_id, status, reserved_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, 'reserved', NOW())
ON CONFLICT (event_id, section_id, seat_number) 
DO UPDATE SET 
  user_id = $4,
  status = 'reserved',
  reserved_at = NOW()
WHERE tickets.user_id IS NULL 
   OR tickets.reserved_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes'
RETURNING *
```

### Phase 6-7: Order Management ✅

## 🎯 Key Technical Achievements

### 1. Dynamic Seat Availability Calculation (Production-Ready) ✅
The system calculates available seats dynamically from the tickets table, eliminating data redundancy:

- **Removed `available_seats` column** from `seating_sections` table
- Seat availability is now calculated in real-time from ticket status
- Uses efficient bulk queries for multiple sections
- Single source of truth (tickets table) prevents data inconsistency
- Helper module `lib/seat-calculations.ts` provides reusable calculation functions

**Migration 008:** Drops the `available_seats` column and its constraints  
**Calculation Logic:** `COUNT(*) WHERE status = 'available'` per section

### 2. Atomic Seat Reservation (Production-Ready) ✅
The system implements a robust, race-condition-free ticket reservation mechanism:

- Uses PostgreSQL's INSERT ON CONFLICT with unique constraint
- Prevents double-booking even with concurrent requests
- Automatic 5-minute expiration for abandoned reservations
- User ownership validation before purchase
- Transaction-based operations for data consistency

### 3. Secure Authentication ✅
- Bcrypt password hashing (10 rounds)
- HTTP-only session cookies
- Server-side validation
- Protected routes with requireAuth()

### 4. Automatic Ticket Generation ✅
- When creating an event with sections, tickets are automatically generated
- Seat numbers follow alphanumeric pattern (A1, A2, B1, B2, etc.)
- All operations wrapped in transactions for atomicity

### 5. Complete User Flow ✅
- User registration and login
- Browse events
- Select seats with visual interface
- Reserve tickets (5-minute hold)
- Complete purchase
- View order history
- Access order details and tickets

## 🚀 Running the Application

```bash
cd ticketing-system

# Start PostgreSQL (already running)
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Verify database
docker-compose ps

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser
http://localhost:3000
```

## 🧪 Testing the Atomic Reservation

To verify the double-booking prevention:

1. Create a test event with sections (requires admin implementation)
2. Open two browser windows with different users
3. Both users attempt to reserve the same seat simultaneously
4. **Expected result:** Only one reservation succeeds
5. After 5 minutes, the reserved seat becomes available again

## 🔄 Recent Refactoring (October 23, 2025)

### Removal of Calculated Fields from Database ✅

Successfully implemented a major refactoring to eliminate data redundancy:

**Changes Made:**
1. ✅ Created `lib/seat-calculations.ts` with helper functions:
   - `calculateAvailableSeats()` - single section calculation
   - `calculateAvailableSeatsBulk()` - efficient multi-section calculation
   - `enrichSectionsWithAvailability()` - adds calculated availability to sections

2. ✅ Updated TypeScript types in `types/index.ts`:
   - Removed `available_seats` from `SeatingSection` base interface
   - Added `SeatingSectionWithAvailability` interface for UI usage
   - Updated all component props to use correct types

3. ✅ Updated all server actions:
   - `event-actions.ts`: Uses `enrichSectionsWithAvailability()` for all queries
   - `ticket-actions.ts`: Removed `available_seats` decrement on purchase
   - `order-actions.ts`: Removed hardcoded `available_seats` from order details

4. ✅ Updated database migrations and seed data:
   - Created `migrations/008_remove_available_seats.sql`
   - Updated `migrations/007_seed_data.sql` (removed from INSERT)
   - Updated `migrations/003_create_seating_sections_table.sql` (for fresh installs)
   - Updated `setup-test-data.sql` (removed from INSERT)

5. ✅ Updated components and hooks:
   - `hooks/use-seat-selection.ts`: Uses `SeatingSectionWithAvailability`
   - All view components properly typed

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Eliminated data redundancy
- ✅ Single source of truth (tickets table)
- ✅ No risk of inconsistent seat counts
- ✅ Simpler database schema
- ✅ Maintains excellent performance with bulk calculations

**Testing:**
- ✅ Application tested and working correctly
- ✅ Event listings show accurate calculated seat counts
- ✅ Event details display correct availability
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ All queries optimized with bulk operations
